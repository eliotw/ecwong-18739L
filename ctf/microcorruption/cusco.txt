According to the overview the buffer overflow has been fixed in this level

however they are still passing the argument of 0x30 to get, so a buffer overflow
is still possible

However, what has changed is that it is no longer checking the string for
the password. It is instead checking the return value of the check password
routine

However, since we can overwrite the buffer by 32 bytes, we can overwrite the return address of the function.
This would allow us to jump to the unlock code address: 4528
