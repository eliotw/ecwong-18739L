Problem:

Fed up with their recent PHP related issues, Daedalus Corp. has switched their website to run on Ruby on Rails (version 3.1.0) instead. Their brand new registration page does not seem like much of an improvement though... [Source].

Notes:

Given the source code, we can see there is a boolean within the user class that is "is_admin", also we note that on the registration page, it takes and sets all parameters given to it.

Flag:

no_framework_is_without_sin
