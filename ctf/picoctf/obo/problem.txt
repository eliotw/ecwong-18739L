Problem:

This password changing program was written by an inexperienced C programmer. Can you some find bugs and exploit them to get the flag? The problem can be found at /home/obo/ on the shell server, and the source code can be downloaded here

Notes:

The programmer has an off-by-one error and it allows use to overwrite the 
first byte of the confirm password. So we just have to pass \1 to confirm
the password

Then we can create a script called python to cat the flag.txt

Flag:

watch_your_bounds
