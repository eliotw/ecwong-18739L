Problem:

This binary uses stack cookies to prevent exploitation, but all hope is not lost. Read the flag from flag.txt anyways! The binary can be found at /home/what_the_flag/ on the shell server. You can solve this problem interactively here. The source can be found here.

Notes:

Can overwrite struct data
gets does not terminate on null characters
Do not do ( echo `perl -e 'print "\x00"'` ) because \x00 will be striped
Instead just directly use (perl -e 'print...) and pipe into program

Flag:

who_needs_%eip
