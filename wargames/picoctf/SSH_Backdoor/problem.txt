Problem:

Some hackers have broken into my server backdoor.picoctf.com and locked my user out (my username is jon). I need to retrieve the flag.txt file from my home directory. 
The last thing we noticed in out network logs show is the attacker downloading this. Can you figure out a way to get back into my account?

Notes:

Downloaded a clean version of openssh and did a diff between the two folders
The password check function was replaced with another one. It would compare the inputed password after it had been XOR with 42 to a static string

The password needed to login to the ssh was iminyourmachinestealingyourflags

Flag:

ssshhhhh_theres_a_backdoor
