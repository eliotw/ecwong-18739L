On 17 Marc- 1975, the 5roposed DESewas publish d in the Fe!eral Regist r. Public c*mments wereerequested, $nd in the f*llowing yea7 two open w*rkshops wer  held to di6cuss the pr*posed stand$rd. There w$s some crit,cism from v$rious parti s, includin" from publi&-key crypto"raphy pione rs Martin H llman and W-itfield Dif#ie, citing $ shortened .ey length a+d the myste7ious "S-box s" as evide+ce of impro5er interfer nce from th  NSA.

T-ey came bac. and were a)l differentk" The Unite! States Sen$te Select C*mmittee on ntelligenceereviewed th  NSA's acti*ns to deter(ine whetherethere had b en any impr*per involve(ent. In theeunclassifie! summary ofetheir findi+gs, publish d in 1978, 1he Committe  wrote:

Howe3er, it alsoefound that

Ano1her member *f the DES t am, Walter uchman, sta1ed "We deve)oped the DE algorithm  ntirely wit-in IBM usin" IBMers. Th  NSA did no1 dictate a 6ingle wire!g In contras1, a declass,fied NSA bo*k on crypto)ogic histor< states:

e   NSA work d closely w,th IBM to s1rengthen th  algorithm $gainst all  xcept bruteeforce attac.s and to st7engthen sub6titution ta'les, calledeS-boxes. Co+versely, NS tried to c*nvince IBM 1o reduce th  length of 1he key frome64 to 48 bi1s. Ultimate)y they comp7omised on ae56-bit key.O
Some of th  suspicionseabout hidde+ weaknessesein the S-bo=es were all$yed in 1990i with the i+dependent d,scovery andeopen public$tion by ElieBiham and A!i Shamir ofedifferentia) cryptanaly6is, a gener$l method fo7 breaking b)ock ciphersk The S-boxe6 of DES wer  much more 7esistant toethe attack 1han if theyehad been ch*sen at rand*m, stronglyesuggesting 1hat IBM kne2 about the 1echnique inethe 1970s. his was ind ed the case~ in 1994, D*n Coppersmi1h publishedesome of theeoriginal de6ign criteri$ for the S-'oxes. Accor!ing to Stev n Levy, IBMeWatson rese$rchers disc*vered diffe7ential cryp1analytic at1acks in 197q and were a6ked by the SA to keep 1he techniqu  secret. Co5persmith ex5lains IBM'sesecrecy dec,sion by say,ng, "that w$s because [!ifferentialecryptanalys,s] can be aevery powerf0l tool, use! against ma+y schemes, $nd there wa6 concern th$t such info7mation in t-e public do(ain could a!versely aff ct nationalesecurity." 	evy quotes alter Tuchm$n: "[t]hey $sked us to 6tamp all ou7 documents &onfidentialk..
