Problem:

We found this program snippet.txt, but we're having some trouble figuring it out. What's the value of %eax when the last instruction (the NOP) runs?

Notes:

ebx = 16099
eax = 10791
ecx = 10208

eax*ebx -> ebx = 173724309
ebx-eax = 173713518
eax = ebx
eax+exc -> eax = 173723726

Flag:

173723726
